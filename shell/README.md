# Shell Workflows

Legacy C-shell scripts used to orchestrate directory generation and batch PDSI execution.

- `pdsi/`: main PDSI loop scripts and folder preparation scripts.
- `utils/`: cleanup and support commands.

These scripts often assume fixed directory layouts and should be reviewed before execution in a new environment.
