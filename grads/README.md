# GrADS Scripts

This directory stores archived GrADS scripts used during the MSc climate modeling workflows.

## Structure

- `pdsi/`: PDSI preprocessing, aggregation, and text export helpers.
- `climate/`: climate variable processing for precipitation, temperature, and related diagnostics.
- `validation/`: model validation scripts against observational datasets.
- `utils/`: plotting, quick diagnostics, and helper scripts.

## Notes

- Most scripts were originally written as one-off research workflow components.
- Absolute paths are still present in several scripts and must be updated before execution.
- File names were preserved to keep historical traceability with dissertation experiments.
